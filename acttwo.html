<I><P> Five people are gathered together in an old, creaky, country house.</I><p>

<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> The Inspector seems to be taking a long time searching upstairs.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF"> I have very little confidence in him.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  Well I have, he was as mystified by the wine glass thing as I was<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> Mystified is right.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  It's true, as far as I can see he has no more idea what is going on than the rest of us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  I think he is going to surprise us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  He frightened me when he said there hadn't been a murder yet. Does that mean he thinks there will be one?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> And does he mean it might be one of us?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF"> One of us what? Who commits the murder or gets Murdered?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes good question.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> And why is he taking so long?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> You know what he said earlier, slowly, slowly catchee monkee<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes he seems to have taken that to heart and just works at one speed.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  Do you think one of us should go up and see if he is ok?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Murial:</font color="#0000FF">  No Jane, he was quite adamant that he did not want us to interfere<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> Going up to see if he is ok is hardly interfering.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Muriel is right Jane. If we go up he will probably accuse us of contaminating the staircase.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  That would not surprise me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> You are probably going to think I am a bit silly if I mention this but something has been bothering me. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Tell us anyway Jane:<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> Please don't moan or groan when I mention this but it is about that glass of wine<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex and Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  (Mockingly) Moan. Groan.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  I knew you would do something like that which is why I kept quiet.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  I am interested Jane. What is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, enlighten us on the mystery of the wine glass.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> It isn't the wine glass as such but connected to it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  When Muriel first asked if we wanted a drink, I asked for a white wine and Michael asked for a scotch.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes I did<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> And did you drink it Michael?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes of course (pause) at least, I think I did.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  I know people can be quite choosy about whisky, so was it to your taste?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> I am not a connoisseur but I believe it was acceptable.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> And you drank it all?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes, I believe I did.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  So where is the glass?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Hmmph, well I don't know, I must have put it back on the drinks table. It is not a mystery.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> I think it is. Muriel, you are the only person that has been near that drinks table, is there a used glass on it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> Let me see (short pause) No, they are all clean.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh this is ridiculous I cannot believe we are making all this fuss about wine and whisky glasses when there is a murder inquiry going on?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  But there is one more thing<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  Go on.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> The second time you asked us if we wanted a drink, when you spotted I had not drunk mine, Michael asked for a scotch 'If there is one'. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  This really does seem rather silly.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> He knew there was scotch because you had served him one previously.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> With all this murder business going on I had probably forgotten.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> And also forgotten where you put the empty glass and to be honest Michael you didn't seem all that convincing when you said you'd drunk it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Of course I drunk it. It didn't just disappear into thin air.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> Apparently it might have done.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  Anyway I can't see that we need to attach any importance to it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> Well I do!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF"> How?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  Because I get the feeling somebody is playing with us<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> What do you mean playing with us Jane?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  I am not really sure but it seems like someone is deliberately trying to confuse us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  Do you think it is the inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> I really don't know.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  Well lets see what he has to say about it when he comes down.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  If he comes down.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  (quite loudly) Ahh inspector. Talk of the devil.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> We were wondering where you had got to.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> You were all very keen for me to be investigating and that is exactly what I have been doing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  And did you find a body.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  No sir, I did not find a body but then, I didn't expect to.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> What did you expect to find then Inspector.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Clues miss, that is what I expected to find, clues.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> And did you find any?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Indeed I did sir but it was not without a problem.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> What kind of problem?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> A crime with too few clues can be difficult to solve. It is my belief that when there are too many clues, solving the case can be even more difficult.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  So just the right number of clues is essential to solving the crime is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Not essential sir but it helps. And I did note your
air of sarcasm.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> Don't mind Michael he is always like this.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Am I?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> Errr yess. I think so.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  So no body Inspector but what clues have you unearthed?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Clues that are surprising and intriguing.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  Can I ask one thing Inspector? Has there actually been a murder?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> I am happy to say as yet, there has not.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  Pheww! Well that's a relief.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> Inspector, you say 'As yet'. As if you are expecting one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> That is true miss. I am. Or at the very least, an attempt.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> Oh no!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  But who? Where?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  As for where, I believe in this very house.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> And who:<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> There you have me sir, I am a police officer, not a clairvoyant. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF"> So you believe there will be a murder but no idea who it will be. Is that correct?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> That is correct sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> Why inspector? What makes you think someone will be murdered.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  The clues miss, because of the clues.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF"> Of which you said, I believe, there are too many.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector.</font color="#0000FF">  Indeed I did sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> I am curious. Is it because there are too many clues that the murder victim is difficult to spot?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Precisely miss, You are very astute.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  Can you share with us the information you have up to now Inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, perhaps that would be a good idea.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> As you said no body but what about the clues, what are they?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> I was coming to that sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  I can't wait to hear.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> Nor can I.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  And so you shall. The clues I found were murder weapons?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> You say weapons not just one weapon Inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Precisely.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> How many?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Four sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  Four! Oh my gosh that is one for each of us.(In a frightened voice) Inspector is someone planning to murder all four of us?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Calm please, and let me explain<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> I think we ought to get out of here<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Please, one moment sir, there is no need for panic.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF"> Seems like there is every need for it to me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  If you will just let me explain<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes please do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Although I found four weapons, they were not all in the same place. In fact not even in the same room.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  So does that suggest anything to you inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, very much so.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF"> In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  It suggests to me that they were not all going to be used by the same person.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  This is getting crazier.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> I was thinking much the same thing miss.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> Do you have any idea at all what is happening inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  No clear idea sir but I am working on my suspicions.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  I think we really all ought to leave, and right now.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  No! Not yet. I can't allow that and at the moment it is not even possible.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> Why ever not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> You will just have to trust me for the moment because it is in your own interests that for the time being you all stay right here.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  So you are saying inspector that the weapons were found in different rooms.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Indeed.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> Can I ask what the weapons are? Could they not be weapons at all? Just something that could<p>
be used as a weapon and left carelessly lying about?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> No sir they are definitely weapons.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  What are they then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Weapon number one is a Glock17. A weapon used by Marines amongst others and it is loaded with 15 rounds.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  Is that a gun?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Yes it is miss.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Ok, no argument about that. I agree it is definitely a weapon.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Item number two is a length of thin piano wire wound onto a wooden handle at each end.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF"> Yuckkkk, even I can see that has got to be a weapon. And such a grisly one too. It has made me shudder.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  A very vicious weapon indeed miss, and as you can see, not some household item that has been carelessly left lying about.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> ok, ok.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  Weapon number three. This is a very crude weapon indeed but a weapon none the less. It is a large gentleman's sock filled with a heavy ball bearings. Strictly speaking we should not necessarily class it as a murder weapon. It could be used to incapacitate someone but used effectively, it could certainly be used for murder.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  Well there is certainly variety.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes there is, which brings me to the final weapon. Which is the most curious.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  In which way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> It is a rather ordinary looking pillow, one that would be at the top of a bed.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> Come now inspector, surely you can't count that as a murder weapon.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  I believe I can sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  But you just said it is an ordinary pillow.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Which it is but something has been added to it which has led me to believe it was intended to smother somebody. To asphyxiate them.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF"> What! What had been added to it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">  I did indeed carry out a very thorough search. I was very meticulous indeed. When I lifted the pillow from the bed, I turned it over and printed on the back in large bold letters, I believe made with a felt marker, was the word 'Goodbye'. I believe that would have been the last thing the victim would have seen.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF">  I agree that is odd, possibly not a weapon but very odd.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  So what are you thinking? Four different murderers, or four different victims?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> I have to ask myself, if there are four different victims does he murderer really need a different weapon for each one?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> Exactly what I was thinking.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF">  So why would there be four different weapons?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF"> Looking at it logically, four different murderers<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">  Oh my gosh!!!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF">  Just a minute. You say there are four different weapons  but what is the use of that? Where are the murderers? <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF"> Yes, there is nobody else here except for the four of us.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector.</font color="#0000FF">  Exactly sir, which is why I must ask you to remain where you are. Nobody is to leave at this point.<p>
